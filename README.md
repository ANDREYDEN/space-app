# Launch.io

An app our team made for NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2018.

It's supposed to run [here](https://launch-io.herokuapp.com/), but it's not always that way.

It's purpose is to provide common people with easy access to the rocket launch information.

At the top of main page user can get time of the next flight. 

Also, it is possible to to pick schedule for special spaceport, by clicking on it's sign on map. The bigger the circle the more flight will be done from this locatin. All data will shown below the map.

Another feature is to filter flight by period of time, which can be choosen by clicking on calendar and picking two dates. Flight are not limited by future, there is access to the done too.

At the top right corner two links are located. First one shows information about reasons when and where rocket will be launch and why a flight can be cancelled. Second links to the list of active rockets and some useful description.
